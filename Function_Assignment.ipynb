        "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, both a **function** and a **method** are callable objects, but they have some key differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Function**:\n",
        "- A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. It can be defined globally or inside a class, but it is not bound to any object.\n",
        "- Functions are defined using the `def` keyword, and they can be called independently of any class or object.\n",
        "- Example of a function:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  def greet(name):\n",
        "      return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
        "  \n",
        "  print(greet(\"Alice\"))\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Method**:\n",
        "- A method is a function that is associated with an object or class. It is defined inside a class and operates on instances (objects) or the class itself.\n",
        "- Methods take the object (or class) as their first argument, which is usually referred to as `self` for instance methods or `cls` for class methods.\n",
        "- Example of a method inside a class:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  class Person:\n",
        "      def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "          self.name = name\n",
        "          \n",
        "      def greet(self):\n",
        "          return f\"Hello, {self.name}!\"\n",
        "  \n",
        "  p = Person(\"Alice\")\n",
        "  print(p.greet())  # Calling the method on the object p\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Differences:\n",
        "- **Context**: Functions can be called directly, while methods are called on objects or classes.\n",
        "- **Binding**: Functions are not tied to an instance of a class, while methods are bound to the instance (or class).\n",
        "- **First Argument**: Methods have an implicit first argument (`self` for instance methods or `cls` for class methods), while functions do not.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the primary distinction is that methods are functions that are part of an object or class, while functions are independent and not tied to any specific object."

        "\n",
        "### 1. **Parameters**:\n",
        "- Parameters are the variables that are defined in the function's definition (the function signature). These are placeholders that specify what kind of data the function expects to receive when called.\n",
        "- They act as local variables within the function that hold the values passed to the function when it is invoked.\n",

        "    return f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Arguments**:\n",
        "- Arguments are the actual values or data that are passed to the function when it is called. These values replace the parameters in the function definition.\n",
        "- Arguments can be of any type, such as numbers, strings, lists, etc., and can be passed in different ways, depending on the function's requirements.\n",
        "\n",

        "4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "  - The `return` statement in a Python function serves the following primary purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Exit the Function**\n",
        "When a `return` statement is encountered, the function immediately exits, and the control is passed back to the caller. This allows the function to terminate early and stop executing further code.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def my_function():\n",
        "    print(\"Start\")\n",
        "    return  # Function exits here\n",
        "    print(\"End\")  # This line will never be executed\n",

        "```\n",
        "Start\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Return a Value**\n",
        "The `return` statement can also send a value back to the caller. This returned value can be assigned to a variable or used directly in expressions.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def add(a, b):\n",
        "    return a + b  # Return the sum of a and b\n",
        "\n",
        "result = add(3, 5)  # The return value is assigned to the variable 'result'\n",
        "print(result)  # Output: 8\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the function `add` returns the sum of `a` and `b`, which is then captured by the variable `result`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Returning Multiple Values**\n",
        "A function can return multiple values as a tuple by separating them with commas. These values can then be unpacked into individual variables when the function is called.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def get_coordinates():\n",
        "    return 10, 20  # Return two values (implicitly a tuple)\n",

        "print(x, y)  # Output: 10 20\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Returning `None` (Implicitly or Explicitly)**\n",
        "If no `return` statement is present in the function, or if the `return` statement is used without specifying a value, Python automatically returns `None`. This indicates the absence of a return value.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def no_return():\n",
        "    print(\"This function doesn't return anything\")\n",

        "print(result)  # Output: None\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "If the function explicitly uses `return` without any expression, it also returns `None`:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def return_none():\n",
        "    return\n",

        "- **Ends Function Execution**: Once `return` is executed, the function stops and control is returned to the caller.\n",
        "- **Returns a Value**: The value or object specified after `return` is passed back to the caller, allowing further use.\n",
        "- **Optional**: A function doesn’t necessarily need to have a `return` statement. If omitted, the function returns `None` by default.\n",
        "\n",

        "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "  - ### **What are Generators in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators in Python are a special type of iterator that allow you to create iterators in a more concise and memory-efficient way. Unlike regular functions that return a single value and exit, a **generator function** yields a series of values one at a time using the `yield` keyword. Each time the generator's `next()` method is called, it returns the next value in the sequence, suspends the function's execution, and remembers the state of the function until the next value is requested.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Key Features of Generators:**\n",
        "- **Lazy Evaluation**: Generators compute values on-the-fly, one at a time, when requested. This makes them memory-efficient for working with large data sets or infinite sequences, since they don’t store all the values at once.\n",
        "- **State Preservation**: After each `yield` statement, the generator function pauses, saving its state (including local variables, position, and execution context). It resumes from where it left off when the next value is requested.\n",
        "- **Iterators**: Generators are iterators, meaning they can be iterated over using a `for` loop or by calling `next()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **How Generators are Defined**\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two primary ways to define a generator:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Using a Generator Function** (using `yield`)\n",
        "2. **Using a Generator Expression** (a compact version of a generator)\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Generator Function:**\n",
        "\n",
        "A generator function is defined like a regular function but contains one or more `yield` statements. Each time the generator function is called, it returns a generator object, which can be used to get values one at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Generator function\n",
        "def count_up_to(max):\n",
        "    count = 1\n",
        "    while count <= max:\n",
        "        yield count  # Pauses and returns the value of 'count'\n",
        "        count += 1\n",
        "\n",
        "# Create a generator object\n",
        "counter = count_up_to(5)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Using the generator object\n",
        "for num in counter:\n",
        "    print(num)  # Outputs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the `count_up_to` function is a generator. It \"yields\" numbers from 1 to the specified maximum value. Each call to `next(counter)` (implicitly done in the `for` loop) resumes execution from the last `yield` and continues until the next `yield` or the end of the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **How `yield` Works**:\n",
        "- When the `yield` statement is executed, the function returns the yielded value to the caller, but the function’s state is saved, allowing it to resume at that point the next time `next()` is called.\n",
        "- When there are no more `yield` statements to execute, the generator raises a `StopIteration` exception, signaling that iteration is complete.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example with `next()`:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def simple_gen():\n",
        "    yield 1\n",

        "\n",
        "### 2. **Generator Expressions:**\n",
        "\n",

        "- **Generators** use **lazy evaluation**, which means that values are computed and yielded only when needed. This can improve performance, especially in scenarios where you don’t need all the values at once.\n",
        "- **Regular functions** that return lists or other collections calculate and store all values upfront, even if only a small part of the data is actually needed.\n",

        "- **Generators** are ideal for creating **infinite sequences** or long-running sequences where storing all the data in memory would be impossible or impractical. They can generate values indefinitely without consuming excessive memory.\n",

        "### 4. **Simpler Code (More Readable)**:\n",
        "- **Generators** can make the code simpler and more **readable** because you don't need to manage state explicitly. When using `yield`, Python automatically handles the suspension and resumption of function execution, reducing boilerplate code and making the logic more intuitive.\n",

        "- **Generators** implicitly handle state management (e.g., keeping track of iteration position). The state of the generator (like the current position in the sequence) is saved automatically, and the function resumes from the point of the last `yield`.\n",

It can have any number of input parameters but can only contain a single expression. The result of the expression is automatically returned, and there is no need to explicitly use the `return` statement.\n",

The purpose of `map()` is to apply a transformation to each item in the iterable, and it is often used when you need to process each element in a collection independently.\n",

        "1. **Transformation**: It applies a given function to each element of the iterable, transforming them as specified by the function.\n",
        "2. **Lazy Evaluation**: `map()` returns a **map object** which is an iterator, meaning the actual computation is done lazily (on-demand), and the elements are not processed until you iterate over them.\n",

        "\n",
        "### **Limitations of `map()`**:\n",
        "1. **Cannot handle multiple iterables with unequal lengths gracefully**: If you pass multiple iterables of unequal lengths, `map()` will stop processing as soon as the shortest iterable is exhausted, and no error is raised.\n",

        "   ```python\n",
        "   list1 = [1, 2, 3]\n",

        "   print(list(result))  # Output: [5, 7] (stops at the shortest iterable)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Requires a function**: You need to provide a function to apply to the iterable(s). This is more general and powerful, but it can be more cumbersome compared to using a simpler list comprehension in some cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Alternatives to `map()`**:\n",
        "1. **List Comprehensions**: If you are creating a new list and want a more Pythonic way to do it, list comprehensions can be a cleaner and more readable alternative.\n",
